Chat Client UI
====================

User interface for the [Chat client Android app peripheral](../../../peripherals/examples/android/chat).

The app acts as BLE chat client, but also advertises as a Bluetooth peripheral that points Summon to this UI.

When opened on Summon, the UI acts as an identical chat client and facilitates conversation with the connected device.
