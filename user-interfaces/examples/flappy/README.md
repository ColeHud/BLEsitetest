Flappy Controller UI
====================

User interface for the [Flappy Bird Android app peripheral](../../../peripherals/examples/android/flappy).

The app runs Flappy Bird, but also advertises as a Bluetooth peripheral that points Summon to this UI.

When opened on Summon, the UI connects via Bluetooth to the device running the app.

The UI then acts as a remote controller for the bird on the app.
