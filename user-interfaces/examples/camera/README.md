Camera Controller UI
====================

User interface for the [Camera Android app peripheral](../../../peripherals/examples/android/camera).

The app acts as a camera viewer, but also advertises as a Bluetooth peripheral that points Summon to this UI.

When opened on Summon, the UI connects via Bluetooth to the device running the app.

The UI then acts as a remote shutter button for the camera.
