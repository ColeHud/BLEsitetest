Flappy BLE Peripheral
=====================

App that runs Flappy Bird on an Android device and acts as a Bluetooth peripheral.

The peripheral can be detected with Summon on other phones and points to the [Flappy Control UI](../../../../user-interfaces/examples/flappy).

When opened on Summon, the UI acts as a BLE remote controller for the bird in the app.
