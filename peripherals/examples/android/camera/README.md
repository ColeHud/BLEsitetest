Camera BLE Peripheral [[APK]](app/app-release.apk)
===========================

App that acts as a camera viewer, but also advertises as a BLE peripheral.

The peripheral can be detected with Summon on other phones and points to the [Camera Controller UI](../../../../user-interfaces/examples/camera).

When opened on Summon, the UI acts as a BLE remote shutter button for the camera.
